# Task 12.5 Completion Summary: Fix Issues and Prepare for Production Deployment

## âœ… Completed: January 10, 2025

### Overview
Task 12.5 successfully addressed critical issues identified during testing and implemented comprehensive production deployment preparation. All accessibility issues, test failures, and production concerns have been resolved.

---

## ðŸ”§ Issues Fixed

### 1. Accessibility Issues
- **Multiple H1 Headings**: Fixed duplicate `<h1>` elements causing accessibility violations
  - TopAppBar: Kept as `<h1>` (main page heading)
  - Sidebar: Changed to `<div>` with proper ARIA attributes
- **Test Update**: Modified `App.test.jsx` to test for proper heading hierarchy

### 2. Console Errors & Warnings
- **React Router Warnings**: Acknowledged future flag warnings (non-breaking)
- **Jest/ESM Compatibility**: Fixed `import.meta` issues in Jest environment
  - Implemented dynamic imports for production config
  - Added environment detection for browser vs Node.js

### 3. Test Infrastructure
- **Unit Tests**: All tests now pass successfully
- **Error Boundary**: Fixed module import issues in test environment
- **Performance**: Reduced test execution time and improved reliability
