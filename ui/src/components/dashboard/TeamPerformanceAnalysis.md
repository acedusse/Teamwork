# TeamPerformance Component Analysis - Subtask 17.1

## Current Implementation Review

### Mock Data Structure

The component currently uses hardcoded mock data defined at the top of the file:

```javascript
// Mock data for demonstration
const teamData = [
  {
    name: 'John Doe',
    role: 'Project Manager',
    tasksCompleted: 15,
    tasksInProgress: 3,
    productivity: 85,
    avatar: 'JD'
  },
  {
    name: 'Jane Smith',
    role: 'Frontend Developer',
    tasksCompleted: 12,
    tasksInProgress: 2,
    productivity: 90,
    avatar: 'JS'
  },
  {
    name: 'Mike Johnson',
    role: 'Backend Developer',
    tasksCompleted: 10,
    tasksInProgress: 4,
    productivity: 75,
    avatar: 'MJ'
  }
];
```

### Component Structure

- Simple functional component with no state management
- Uses Material-UI components for styling and layout
- Directly maps over static `teamData` array to render team members
- No data fetching, loading states, or error handling
- All data is hardcoded within the component file
- No external data sources or API integration

### Required Data Fields

For each team member, the component expects:

| Field           | Type    | Description                           | Example        |
|-----------------|---------|---------------------------------------|----------------|
| name            | string  | Team member's full name              | "John Doe"     |
| role            | string  | Team member's job title              | "Project Manager" |
| tasksCompleted  | number  | Count of completed tasks             | 15             |
| tasksInProgress | number  | Count of tasks currently in progress | 3              |
| productivity    | number  | Productivity percentage (0-100)      | 85             |
| avatar          | string  | Initials or identifier for avatar    | "JD"           |

### Rendering Logic

The component renders each team member's data as follows:

1. Maps over the `teamData` array with each member rendered as a card
2. For each member:
   - Displays avatar with initials in a circular container
   - Shows name as subtitle1 and role as caption text
   - Renders a productivity bar with percentage using LinearProgress
   - Shows counts for completed and in-progress tasks in a two-column layout

### UI Structure Elements

- Box containers with custom styling
- Typography components for text elements (subtitle1, caption, body2)
- LinearProgress for productivity visualization
- Custom theme colors and spacing
- Responsive layouts with flexbox

### Component Limitations

1. No data fetching mechanism currently exists
2. No loading states or error handling
3. No reactive updates if data changes
4. Component expects pre-calculated productivity metrics
5. No time-based filtering functionality
6. No sorting options
7. Limited to only three hardcoded team members
8. No expandable information or detailed views
