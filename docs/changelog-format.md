# Changelog Format

Task Master follows the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) style. Changes are grouped by version and type (Major, Minor, Patch). Version bumps are handled with [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets).

When adding a user facing change, create a changeset using `npm run changeset`. After release, the summary appears in `CHANGELOG.md` under the appropriate version.
