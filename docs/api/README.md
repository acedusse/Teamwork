# API Documentation

This directory contains documentation for using Task Master as a Node module and for integrating with the MCP server.

- **CLI Usage** – see the main [README](../README.md#installation) for command line installation and commands.
- **Node Module** – import functions from `scripts/` or `src/` to build custom tools.
- **MCP Server** – the server exposed in `mcp-server/` follows the Model Control Protocol and can be extended with new tools.

Additional pages can be added under this folder to document individual modules or endpoints.
