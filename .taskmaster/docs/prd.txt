# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Overview
Scrumban AI Development Dashboard: A collaborative, AI-powered agile planning and execution platform. The goal is to provide a modern, modular dashboard for software teams, integrating collaborative planning, sprint management, kanban board, flow optimization, and continuous improvement, all powered by AI agents.

## 2. Core Features
- **Collaborative Planning Tab**: Phase tracker, brainstorming, ideation board, AI agent participation, research/documentation hub.
- **Bucket Planning Tab**: Time horizon buckets (year, quarter, month), drag-and-drop story allocation.
- **Sprint Planning Tab**: Sprint setup, story selection, capacity planning, dependency management, sprint metrics.
- **Scrumban Board Tab**: Kanban columns (Backlog, Ready, Development, Code Review, Testing, Done), WIP limits, drag-and-drop, task cards, real-time updates.
- **Flow Optimization Tab**: Metrics charts, bottleneck detection, optimization suggestions.
- **Continuous Improvement Tab**: Retrospectives, action items, improvement tracking.
- **Modals**: Agent/session/task/dependency management.
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Multi-user, multi-agent, voting, grouping, clustering.

## 2a. User Stories & Features
- As a product owner, I want to see a collaborative planning tab with a phase tracker, so I can guide the team through each planning stage.
- As a team member, I want to participate in brainstorming and add ideas to an ideation board, so all voices are captured.
- As a user, I want to invite AI agents to contribute to planning and research, so we get expert recommendations and automated analysis.
- As a planner, I want to allocate stories and features into year, quarter, and month buckets using drag-and-drop, so we can visualize our roadmap.
- As a scrum master, I want to set up sprints, select stories, and manage team capacity, so we can plan realistic sprints.
- As a developer, I want to see and manage dependencies between tasks and stories, so blockers are visible and can be resolved.
- As a team, we want a Scrumban board with columns for each workflow stage, WIP limits, and drag-and-drop task cards, so we can visualize and manage our work in progress.
- As a QA, I want to see which tasks are blocked, in review, or ready for testing, so I can prioritize my work.
- As a team, we want real-time updates and notifications when tasks move or change status, so everyone stays in sync.
- As a PM, I want to see sprint metrics, flow charts, and bottleneck analysis, so I can optimize team performance.
- As a team, we want to run retrospectives, record action items, and track improvements, so we continuously get better.
- As a user, I want all modals (agent, session, task, dependency) to be accessible and easy to use.
- As a developer, I want keyboard shortcuts and accessibility features throughout the dashboard.
- As a user, I want to be able to export boards, reports, and research findings for documentation and sharing.

## 3. User Experience
- Modern, responsive UI (Material-UI style)
- Drag-and-drop everywhere (stories, tasks, buckets)
- Keyboard shortcuts and accessibility
- Real-time updates and notifications
- Visual progress indicators, metrics, and charts
- Seamless navigation between planning, execution, and improvement

## 4. Technical Architecture
- React frontend with modular component structure
- Node.js/Express backend with REST API
- AI agent integration for planning, analysis, and feedback
- WebSocket for real-time collaboration
- File-based and API-based data storage (tasks, sessions, agents)
- Role-based access: Business Analyst, Tech Lead, UX Designer, Product Owner, QA, ML, DevOps, etc.

## 5. Development Roadmap (Approved Plan)
- Extract all major UI sections from ai_dev_planning_workflow.html into React components.
- Place new components in ui/src/components/dashboard/ (or planning/).
- Update Dashboard.jsx to use the new layout and tab system.
- Remove all old Dashboard components, pages, and styles.
- Route all dashboard navigation to the new components.
- Convert all embedded JS logic to React hooks/utilities.
- Move all styles to SCSS/CSS modules.
- Integrate with existing state management and API services.
- Test all features and remove all references to the old Dashboard.
- Update documentation and developer notes.

## 6. Logical Dependency Chain
1. Extract and modularize UI sections (Collaborative, Bucket, Sprint, Board, Flow, Improvement)
2. Refactor navigation and routing
3. Remove old Dashboard code and styles
4. Integrate new components with state/API
5. Implement real-time collaboration features
6. Test and validate all tabs and modals
7. Update documentation and onboard team

## 7. Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Loss of features during migration. **Mitigation**: Map all old features to new components, test thoroughly.
- **Risk**: Integration complexity. **Mitigation**: Modularize and test each tab/page independently before full integration.
- **Risk**: User confusion during transition. **Mitigation**: Provide clear documentation and migration notes.

## 8. Appendix
- Ideation board sample: AI-powered code generation, real-time collaboration, reporting, etc.
- Research findings: Market growth, developer pain points, competitive analysis.
- Example user stories: As a developer, I want to upload requirements and get code templates; as a PM, I want to track real-time progress.
