# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup React Project Foundation with Material-UI
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize React 18+ project with Material-UI, custom earth-tone theming, and development tooling
# Details:
Create new React project using Create React App or Vite. Install Material-UI (@mui/material, @mui/icons-material), React Router, and development dependencies (ESLint, Jest). Configure custom earth-tone theme using Material-UI's createTheme with primary colors in earth tones (browns, greens, warm grays). Set up project structure with components/, pages/, hooks/, and utils/ directories. Configure ESLint rules and Jest testing framework. Create basic App.js with Material-UI ThemeProvider wrapper.

# Test Strategy:
Verify project builds successfully, Material-UI theme applies correctly, and all development tools (linting, testing) work properly. Test theme consistency across basic components.
