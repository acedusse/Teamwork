# Task ID: 8
# Title: Build Dependency Graph Visualization
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create interactive dependency graph with visualization controls and dependency management tools
# Details:
Implement dependency graph visualization using a graph library like vis.js, cytoscape.js, or D3.js. Create interactive nodes representing tasks with edges showing dependencies. Add zoom, pan, and focus controls for navigation. Implement filtering to show subsets of dependencies. Create interface for adding/removing dependencies with validation to prevent circular dependencies. Add dependency path highlighting and critical path analysis. Include layout algorithms for optimal graph presentation. Provide export functionality for dependency diagrams.

# Test Strategy:
Verify graph correctly displays task dependencies, interaction controls work smoothly, dependency creation/deletion updates graph in real-time, circular dependency validation prevents invalid relationships, and performance is acceptable with complex dependency networks.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up graph visualization library and basic rendering [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize the chosen graph visualization library (vis.js, cytoscape.js, or D3.js) and implement basic graph rendering with task nodes and dependency edges.
### Details:
Research and select the most appropriate visualization library based on project requirements. Set up the library in the project. Create a basic component that renders tasks as nodes and dependencies as directed edges. Implement the data transformation logic to convert the application's task and dependency data into the format required by the visualization library. Ensure the graph is properly contained within its viewport.

## 2. Implement interactive navigation controls [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Add user controls for navigating the dependency graph, including zoom, pan, and focus functionality.
### Details:
Implement zoom in/out controls with mouse wheel and button support. Add panning capability with mouse drag. Create a focus/center function to highlight selected tasks and their immediate dependencies. Implement a reset view button to return to the default graph view. Ensure smooth transitions between different view states with appropriate animations.

## 3. Create dependency management interface [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Build an interface for adding, removing, and editing dependencies between tasks with validation to prevent circular dependencies.
### Details:
Implement click or drag interactions to create new dependency edges between tasks. Add right-click or similar context menu for removing dependencies. Create validation logic to detect and prevent circular dependencies when adding new connections. Display appropriate error messages when invalid dependencies are attempted. Add visual feedback during dependency creation/deletion operations.

## 4. Develop filtering and layout algorithms [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2
### Description: Implement filtering capabilities to show subsets of the dependency graph and layout algorithms for optimal graph presentation.
### Details:
Create filters to show dependencies by criteria such as task status, priority, or assigned team members. Implement different layout algorithms (hierarchical, force-directed, circular) and allow users to switch between them. Add a mini-map for navigation in large graphs. Optimize layout calculations for performance with large dependency networks. Include options to collapse/expand groups of related tasks.

## 5. Add advanced analysis and export features [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.3, 8.4
### Description: Implement dependency path highlighting, critical path analysis, and export functionality for dependency diagrams.
### Details:
Create algorithms to identify and highlight the critical path through the dependency network. Implement path highlighting to show all dependencies leading to or from a selected task. Add visual indicators for dependency types or strengths if applicable. Create export options for the dependency graph in common formats (PNG, SVG, JSON). Implement print-friendly view optimization. Add tooltips or information panels showing detailed dependency information.

INTEGRATION UPDATE: DependencyGraph component successfully integrated into App.jsx with mock data and routing configured for /dependencies endpoint. React development server now serves the dependency graph visualization at the dependencies page. Manual testing required to verify all implemented features including critical path analysis, dependency highlighting, export functionality, and interactive tooltips are working correctly in the integrated environment.
