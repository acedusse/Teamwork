Key gaps identified include lack of real-time validation, missing validation for priority/assignee/tags/dependencies fields, limited error messaging, no field relationship validation, no form state persistence, and insufficient accessibility features. Files analyzed: TaskCreationForm.jsx, TaskModal.jsx, taskService.js.

Real-time connectivity monitoring established using navigator.onLine with custom offline service and visual status indicators. Draft persistence system implemented with automatic saving via autosaveService, 24-hour retention with cleanup, and cross-session localStorage persistence. Priority-based request queuing system created for offline operations with automatic sync on reconnection, exponential backoff retry mechanism, and optimistic UI updates with rollback capability. Enhanced TaskCreationForm now includes offline-aware submission, 2-second auto-save intervals, 30-second network timeout handling, and comprehensive visual feedback. Key implementation files: TaskCreationForm.jsx, offlineService.js, autosaveService.js, taskServiceOffline.js, and OfflineTaskCreationDemo.jsx. All features verified working including offline task creation with queuing, draft restoration across sessions, automatic sync on reconnection, visual offline/online indicators, network timeout handling, cross-tab communication, and accessibility support. OfflineTaskCreationDemo component created for comprehensive manual testing with simulated offline/online toggling and real-time sync monitoring.

Ensure the Add Task button correctly uses React Router's navigation:\n```jsx\nimport { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';\n\nfunction TopAppBar() {\n  const navigate = useNavigate();\n  \n  const handleAddTaskClick = () => {\n    navigate('/tasks/new');\n  };\n  \n  return (\n    // ... existing code\n    <Button \n      variant=\"contained\" \n      color=\"primary\" \n      startIcon={<AddIcon />}\n      onClick={handleAddTaskClick}\n    >\n      Add Task\n    </Button>\n    // ... existing code\n  );\n}\n```\n\n4.
