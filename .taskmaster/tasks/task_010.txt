# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Keyboard Shortcuts and Accessibility Features
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add comprehensive keyboard navigation, shortcuts, and WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
# Details:
Implement keyboard shortcuts for common actions (create task: Ctrl+N, search: Ctrl+F, navigate sections: Ctrl+1-6). Add full keyboard navigation support using tab order and arrow keys. Implement ARIA attributes for screen reader compatibility. Ensure color contrast meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards. Add focus indicators and skip links. Create keyboard shortcut help dialog. Implement semantic HTML structure. Add alt text for images and icons. Test with screen readers and keyboard-only navigation.

# Test Strategy:
Verify all functionality is accessible via keyboard, screen reader testing confirms proper ARIA implementation, color contrast analyzer validates accessibility standards, and keyboard shortcuts work consistently across all interfaces.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Keyboard Shortcuts for Common Actions [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add keyboard shortcuts for frequently used actions including task creation, search, and section navigation
### Details:
Create a keyboard shortcut service that registers and handles key combinations. Implement the following shortcuts: Ctrl+N for creating new tasks, Ctrl+F for focusing the search input, and Ctrl+1 through Ctrl+6 for navigating between main application sections. Use a key binding library or implement event listeners that check for specific key combinations. Ensure shortcuts don't conflict with browser defaults where possible.

## 2. Add Full Keyboard Navigation Support [done]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Implement complete keyboard navigation throughout the application using proper tab order and arrow key controls
### Details:
Ensure all interactive elements are properly tabbable with logical tab order (tabindex). Implement arrow key navigation within components like lists, menus, and grids. Add focus trapping for modals and dialogs. Ensure the current focus is always visible and logical. Create skip links to bypass repetitive navigation. Review and fix any elements that can't be accessed via keyboard.

## 3. Implement ARIA Attributes and Screen Reader Compatibility [done]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Add appropriate ARIA roles, states, and properties to make the application compatible with screen readers
### Details:
Audit the application and add appropriate ARIA attributes: roles (e.g., button, menu, dialog), states (e.g., aria-expanded, aria-checked), and properties (e.g., aria-label, aria-describedby). Implement live regions for dynamic content updates. Ensure form inputs have associated labels. Use semantic HTML elements where possible (header, nav, main, etc.). Add descriptive alt text for all images and icons.

## 4. Ensure Visual Accessibility Compliance [done]
### Dependencies: 10.3
### Description: Implement visual accessibility features to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards including color contrast and focus indicators
### Details:
Audit and fix color contrast issues to ensure text meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text). Add visible focus indicators for all interactive elements. Ensure the application is usable at 200% zoom. Make sure text can be resized without loss of functionality. Verify that information is not conveyed by color alone. Add alternative visual cues where needed.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE. Major Components: 1) Visual Accessibility CSS with WCAG 2.1 AA compliant color palette, enhanced focus indicators, zoom support, and responsive design. 2) Visual Accessibility Tester component providing real-time color contrast testing, zoom compatibility checks, and accessibility reporting. 3) Enhanced accessibility layer with touch target sizing, color-independent status indicators with icons, and high contrast mode support. Features: Color contrast validation with live feedback, 200% zoom compatibility testing, status indicators with visual patterns beyond color, enhanced focus management with keyboard/mouse detection, responsive design that works at all zoom levels, high contrast and reduced motion preference support, and comprehensive WCAG 2.1 AA compliance validation tools.

## 5. Create Keyboard Shortcut Help Dialog and Documentation [done]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.4
### Description: Implement a help dialog that displays all available keyboard shortcuts and create accessibility documentation
### Details:
Create a modal dialog that shows all keyboard shortcuts, organized by category. Add a keyboard shortcut (e.g., '?') to open this dialog. Ensure the dialog is fully accessible with proper focus management. Create comprehensive documentation of all accessibility features including keyboard shortcuts, navigation patterns, and screen reader support. Add a visible link to this documentation in the application.
<info added on 2025-06-10T01:41:09.256Z>
IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE. Successfully delivered comprehensive keyboard shortcuts and accessibility features including: Keyboard Shortcut Help Dialog component with 30+ shortcuts organized across 6 categories (Navigation, Task Management, Search, Dialog, Accessibility, Application), featuring full accessibility support with focus trapping, ARIA attributes, screen reader compatibility, and '?' key trigger functionality. Comprehensive Accessibility Guide HTML document ensuring WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with detailed coverage of keyboard navigation patterns, screen reader support, visual accessibility features, assistive technology compatibility, and support resources. Integrated accessible TopAppBar link providing easy access to accessibility documentation. Key features include responsive design for mobile and desktop, high contrast and reduced motion support, proper focus management with escape handling, print-friendly styles, multilingual keyboard notation support (Mac vs PC), and comprehensive compliance documentation with detailed sections and badges. All requirements for keyboard shortcuts help dialog and accessibility documentation have been successfully fulfilled.
