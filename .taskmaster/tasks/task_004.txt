# Task ID: 4
# Title: Build PRD Upload and Processing Interface
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create file upload component with drag-and-drop support and PRD content preview/editing capabilities
# Details:
Implement file upload component using Material-UI with drag-and-drop functionality for PRD documents. Support common file formats (PDF, DOC, TXT, MD). Create PRD content preview component with syntax highlighting for markdown. Add editing capabilities using a rich text editor or code editor component. Implement file validation (size limits up to 50KB, file type checking). Create progress indicator for file upload and processing. Add real-time progress display during task generation process. Integrate with existing parse-prd backend functionality.

# Test Strategy:
Test file upload with various formats and sizes, verify drag-and-drop functionality, ensure content preview displays correctly, validate editing capabilities work properly, and confirm integration with backend PRD processing.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement file upload component with drag-and-drop [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a Material-UI based file upload component that supports drag-and-drop functionality for PRD documents
### Details:
Use Material-UI's Card component as a container. Implement drag-and-drop using react-dropzone library. Support file formats: PDF, DOC, TXT, MD. Add visual feedback for drag hover state. Include a fallback button for manual file selection. Display selected filename after upload. Implement file validation for size limits (50KB) and file type checking with appropriate error messages.

## 2. Create PRD content preview component [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Develop a preview component that displays the content of uploaded PRD files with syntax highlighting for markdown
### Details:
Use a library like react-markdown or marked for rendering markdown content. Implement syntax highlighting with prism.js or highlight.js. Create a tabbed interface to switch between raw and rendered views. For non-markdown files, display appropriate previews (PDF viewer for PDFs, text for DOC/TXT). Handle loading states and error cases gracefully. Ensure the preview component has responsive design for different screen sizes.

## 3. Add PRD content editing capabilities [done]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Implement editing functionality for PRD content using a rich text editor or code editor component
### Details:
Integrate a rich text editor like Draft.js, Slate.js, or Monaco Editor. Implement toolbar with basic formatting options (bold, italic, lists, headings). Add keyboard shortcuts for common editing operations. Create toggle between edit and preview modes. Implement auto-save functionality with debounce. Add undo/redo capabilities. Ensure the editor maintains the original formatting of the document.

## 4. Implement upload progress indicator and real-time processing display [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Create visual indicators for file upload progress and real-time updates during PRD processing
### Details:
Use Material-UI's LinearProgress or CircularProgress components for upload progress. Implement WebSocket connection for real-time updates during processing. Display step-by-step progress messages during PRD parsing. Add estimated time remaining if possible. Implement error handling with user-friendly error messages. Create a cancellable upload process with proper cleanup.

## 5. Integrate with parse-prd backend functionality [done]
### Dependencies: 4.3, 4.4
### Description: Connect the frontend components with the existing backend API for PRD parsing and processing
### Details:
Create API service module for backend communication. Implement file upload endpoint integration using FormData and fetch/axios. Handle authentication and authorization for API requests. Implement error handling and retries for failed requests. Create data transformation functions to convert between frontend and backend data formats. Add proper loading states during API calls. Implement caching for previously processed PRDs if applicable.
