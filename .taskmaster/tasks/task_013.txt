# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Task Creation Functionality
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 3, 6, 11
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a complete task creation system with proper routing, forms, state management, API integration, validation, and user feedback to fix the non-functional add task button in TopAppBar.
# Details:
1. Create a new route `/tasks/new` in the React Router configuration that renders a TaskCreationForm component.

2. Develop the TaskCreationForm component with the following fields:
   - Task title (required)
   - Description (optional)
   - Priority selector (dropdown: low, medium, high)
   - Due date (date picker)
   - Assignee (user selector)
   - Tags/labels (multi-select)
   - Dependencies (task selector showing existing tasks)

3. Implement form state management using React's useState or a form library like Formik or React Hook Form with proper validation:
   - Title must be non-empty and between 3-100 characters
   - Description limited to 1000 characters
   - Due date must be current or future date
   - Show validation errors inline with appropriate styling

4. Create API integration for task creation:
   - Implement a createTask service function that sends POST request to backend API
   - Handle API errors with appropriate user feedback
   - Implement optimistic updates to show new task immediately while saving in background

5. Add loading states during API calls:
   - Disable submit button during submission
   - Show loading spinner or progress indicator
   - Handle network timeouts gracefully

6. Implement success and error notifications:
   - Display toast notification on successful task creation
   - Show error messages for failed submissions
   - Provide guidance on how to resolve validation issues

7. Add navigation logic:
   - Redirect to the newly created task detail view on success
   - Provide cancel button that returns to previous screen
   - Implement confirmation dialog if user tries to leave with unsaved changes

8. Ensure the form is fully accessible:
   - Add proper ARIA attributes
   - Ensure keyboard navigation works correctly
   - Implement focus management

9. Connect the Add Task button in TopAppBar to the new route:
   - Update the onClick handler to use React Router's navigation
   - Add keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+N) for quick task creation

10. Implement offline support:
    - Queue task creation requests when offline
    - Sync when connection is restored
    - Store draft in local storage to prevent data loss

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Write unit tests for the TaskCreationForm component using Jest and React Testing Library
   - Test form validation logic for all fields
   - Test form submission with mock API calls
   - Verify error handling and success scenarios

2. Integration Testing:
   - Test the integration between the Add Task button and the task creation form
   - Verify proper routing between components
   - Test API integration with mock server responses
   - Verify state updates after successful task creation

3. End-to-End Testing:
   - Create Cypress or Playwright tests that simulate a user clicking the Add Task button
   - Complete the entire task creation workflow
   - Verify the task appears in the task list after creation
   - Test validation error scenarios and recovery

4. Accessibility Testing:
   - Verify the form is navigable using only keyboard
   - Test with screen readers to ensure all fields are properly announced
   - Check color contrast and focus indicators

5. Offline Testing:
   - Simulate offline conditions using browser dev tools
   - Verify task creation works when offline
   - Test synchronization when connection is restored

6. Cross-browser Testing:
   - Test in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
   - Verify mobile responsiveness on different screen sizes

7. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Have product stakeholders verify the task creation workflow
   - Collect feedback on form usability and clarity

8. Performance Testing:
   - Measure form rendering and submission times
   - Verify the form doesn't cause performance issues in the main application

<info added on 2025-06-12T01:02:47.236Z>
EXPLORATION PHASE 1 COMPLETED: Comprehensive analysis of existing TaskCreationForm component reveals solid foundation with basic form state management using React useState for title, description, priority, dueDate, assignee, tags, and dependencies. Current validation covers title (required, 3-100 characters), description (max 1000 characters), and due date (current/future only) but only triggers on form submission. Key gaps identified include lack of real-time validation, missing validation for priority/assignee/tags/dependencies fields, limited error messaging, no field relationship validation, no form state persistence, and insufficient accessibility features. Files analyzed: TaskCreationForm.jsx, TaskModal.jsx, taskService.js. Enhancement plan established for comprehensive real-time validation, improved error display, form state caching, and accessibility improvements to achieve production-ready validation standards.
