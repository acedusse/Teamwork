# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Sprint Planning and Management Interface
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Create sprint creation, task assignment, and timeline visualization features
# Details:
Build sprint creation interface with form for sprint name, start/end dates, and goals. Implement drag-and-drop task assignment from backlog to sprints. Create sprint timeline visualization using Material-UI components or charting library. Add sprint management controls (start, pause, complete sprint). Implement sprint backlog view with capacity planning. Create sprint progress tracking with burndown charts. Add sprint retrospective interface for notes and feedback. Support multiple active sprints. Integrate with existing task data structure.

# Test Strategy:
Test sprint creation with various parameters, verify drag-and-drop task assignment works correctly, validate timeline visualization displays accurate data, and confirm sprint management operations update data properly.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Sprint Creation Form Interface [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a form interface for creating new sprints with fields for sprint name, start/end dates, and sprint goals.
### Details:
Build a React component using Material-UI form elements. Include text fields for sprint name and goals, date pickers for start/end dates, and validation to ensure dates are valid and sequential. Add form submission handler that creates a new sprint object in the application state. Design should be consistent with existing UI patterns.

## 2. Implement Drag-and-Drop Task Assignment [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create functionality to assign tasks from the backlog to sprints using drag-and-drop interaction.
### Details:
Use React DnD or a similar library to implement drag-and-drop functionality. Create draggable task components in the backlog view and droppable zones in the sprint backlog. Implement handlers to update task data with sprint assignment when dropped. Add visual feedback during drag operations. Update the data model to track sprint assignments for tasks.
<info added on 2025-06-07T15:44:52.744Z>
Implementation completed successfully using @dnd-kit library instead of React DnD. Created TaskSprintAssignment component with full drag-and-drop functionality including draggable tasks from backlog to sprint zones, visual feedback during drag operations, and task removal capabilities. Sprint zones now display task counts for better visibility. Component integrated into SprintPlanning page using tabbed interface. Resolved date adapter compatibility issue by switching from date-fns to dayjs. All functionality tested and build verified successful.

<info added on 2025-06-07T15:44:58.194Z>
The drag-and-drop task assignment functionality has been fully implemented and tested. The TaskSprintAssignment component provides a complete solution for moving tasks between backlog and sprint zones with intuitive visual feedback and proper data persistence.

## 3. Develop Sprint Timeline Visualization [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a visual representation of sprint timelines showing start/end dates, current progress, and assigned tasks.
### Details:
Implement a timeline component using either Material-UI components or a specialized charting library like Chart.js or react-vis. Display sprints as timeline bars with clear date indicators. Show current date marker and progress. Include task distribution visualization within each sprint bar. Make the timeline interactive to allow clicking into sprints for details.
<info added on 2025-06-07T15:50:03.941Z>
Sprint timeline visualization has been successfully completed. Created SprintTimelineVisualization component featuring interactive timeline bars with progress indicators and current date markers. Added zoom controls for better navigation and sprint statistics display. Component has been integrated as the third tab in the SprintPlanning page. Build completed successfully and is ready for use.

## 4. Build Sprint Management Controls [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement controls to start, pause, and complete sprints, with appropriate state management and UI feedback.
### Details:
Create action buttons for sprint state changes (start, pause, complete). Implement state management logic to track sprint status. Add confirmation dialogs for irreversible actions like completing a sprint. Update timeline visualization to reflect sprint status. Implement business logic for sprint transitions, including validation (e.g., preventing completion if tasks remain unfinished).
<info added on 2025-06-07T16:02:12.291Z>
Sprint Management Controls component successfully implemented and integrated. Component includes comprehensive action buttons for all sprint state transitions, intelligent validation logic that prevents invalid operations, real-time progress tracking capabilities, user-friendly confirmation dialogs for critical actions, and robust status management system. Component has been added as the 4th tab in the SprintPlanning page interface. Timeline visualization has been updated to properly display and reflect new sprint statuses. All functionality tested and build completed successfully without errors.

## 5. Implement Sprint Progress Tracking with Burndown Charts [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create burndown chart visualization and sprint statistics to track progress throughout the sprint lifecycle.
### Details:
Implement a burndown chart component using a charting library. Calculate and display ideal burndown line based on sprint start/end dates and total story points. Track actual progress line based on completed tasks. Add sprint statistics panel showing completion percentage, remaining work, and velocity metrics. Update charts in real-time as tasks are completed. Include filters to view different sprints.
<info added on 2025-06-07T16:10:24.802Z>
Sprint Progress Tracking with Burndown Charts fully implemented! Created comprehensive SprintProgressTracking component with interactive line charts using Recharts showing ideal vs actual progress, real-time progress visualization with story points tracking, and multi-sprint support with sprint selector. Added comprehensive metrics dashboard with completion rates and velocity, progress indicators with visual progress bars, on-track/behind schedule indicators, and days remaining with projected completion calculations. Included pie chart showing task status distribution, task listing with completion status icons, and real-time updates as task statuses change. Integrated as 5th tab (Progress Tracking) in SprintPlanning page, enhanced sample data with story points for realistic burndown calculations, and connected to existing sprint and task data. Build tested successfully with no errors. Feature complete with professional UI and comprehensive functionality.
