# Task ID: 5
# Title: Develop Kanban Task Board with Filtering and Search
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create interactive kanban-style task board with drag-and-drop functionality, filtering, and search capabilities
# Details:
Build kanban board using Material-UI components with columns for different task statuses (pending, in-progress, completed, blocked). Implement drag-and-drop functionality using react-beautiful-dnd or @dnd-kit for moving tasks between columns. Create task cards displaying key information (title, priority, assignee, due date). Add comprehensive filtering by status, priority, assignee, and tags. Implement search functionality across task titles and descriptions. Create sorting options (priority, due date, creation date). Add quick actions on task cards (edit, delete, view details). Ensure real-time updates when tasks are modified.

# Test Strategy:
Test drag-and-drop between columns updates task status correctly, filtering and search return accurate results, task cards display correct information, and quick actions work properly. Verify performance with up to 500 tasks.

# Subtasks:
